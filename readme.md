# Word Generator
This is a word generator. This takes many syllables from real words and then uses it with some small rules. I will
outline all of the rules here.
## Vowels and Consonants
Vowels and consonants require rules to be able to properly connect. So, that the words that are generated with said
syllables actually make coherent sense and can be read as though they are real english words.
### Rule 1: How are consonants treated?
Generally speaking, all vowels can preceed and follow all other vowels. However, the same cannot be said for consonants.
